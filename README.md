# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
- This dataset contains data about information  related to a direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution and its attempts to get its clients to subscribe for a term deposit, we seek to predict if the client is subscribed for a term deposite or not and classify the predictions based on the personal and financial information by client.

- The best performing model was a Soft type of Voting Classifier (VotingEnsemble), using MaxAbcScaler and XGBoostClassifier which implements the Gradient tree boosting algorythm, as it's a well known for the effiency to predict accuracies. 

This model was chosen among several models based on the highest accuracy, while tuning the hyperdrive parameters during the experiment.
Getting good results or bad ones are always related to two important things: 
 1 - The dataset and the cleaning: In this project we a clean data method from a script which contains:
       * Get the dataset as a csv from a link using TabularDatasetFactory and convert it to a DataFrame using pandas to clean it
       * Convert string columns(education,job and contact) using get_dummies() function which aims to convert string simple column into a dataframe binary representation 
      


## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
