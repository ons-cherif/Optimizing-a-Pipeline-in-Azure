# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
- This dataset contains information related to a direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution and if their clients did subscribe for a term deposit.<br>
We seek to predict if clients are subscibed for a term deposit based on the provided personal and financial information.

- The best performing model is a SoftVotingClassifier (VotingEnsemble), containing MaxAbcScaler and XGBoostClassifier which implements the Gradient tree boosting algorithm_  well known for its efficiency to predict accuracies. 
This model has been chosen among several models based on the highest accuracy, while tuning the hyperdrive parameters during the experiment.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

Below a general pipeline architecture is provided to explain the workflow of using Azure SDK with HyperDrive parameterization:

Actually, getting good or bad results, is related to how well your model is prepared: 

1 - **The dataset and the cleaning: We used a Cleaing function included in the Train.py Script.** <br>
   - Use TabularDatasetFactory method to retreive data from the specified path.<br>
   - Convert the extracted data into a binary dataframe representation that will be used later with the LogisticRegression classifier. We used Get_dummies() for the string type columns and lambda expressions for bolean columns, and returned x_df and y_df to be used at a later stage of the experiment.<br>
   - We specify the Hyperparameters to be used during the experiment. For this cas, we will consider:
      - The inverse of regularization strength: _**C**_<br>
   and <br>
      - The maximum number of iterations taken for the solvers to converge: _**max_iter**_<br>
    
2- **The algorithm choice:** The choice of the algorithm used in your model must be based on the metrics you need to predict: continious or discret?<br>
Since we will be estimating if the client did subscribe or not to a deposit term, we applied Sklearn LogistigRegression classifier using the dataset we cleaned and splited to training/testing datasets using Sklearn function *train_test_split* 
 

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
